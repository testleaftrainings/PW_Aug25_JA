Website: https://the-internet.herokuapp.com/javascript_alerts

Question:

A confirmation alert appears when clicking the "Click for JS Confirm" button.
You need to dismiss the alert and verify that the result text is "You clicked: Cancel".

How will you handle this using Playwright?

How would your code react if the alert is not handled?

How do you simulate both accept and cancel flows?
