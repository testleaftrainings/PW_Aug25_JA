### **TypeScript Interview Questions**

1. What is TypeScript and how is it different from JavaScript?
2. What are the benefits of using TypeScript in automation projects?
3. What is type inference in TypeScript?
4. Explain the use of "?" (optional parameter)** and "!" (non-null assertion)**.

function greet(name?:string){

console.log("Hello"+(name ? name :"Guest"))

# //Internally:
#   // if(name){
#    Hello Ravi
#    }
#    else(){
#    Hello Guest
#    }

}

greet("Ravi")
greet()



5. What is a union type and how do you use it?
6. Difference between `any`, `unknown`, `never`
7. What is type assertion and how do you do it?

let num : string = "Ravi"  --> Explicit infere

let url = value as string // external database or any data file like csv , env, 

let password = pwd as string // "Ravi#$%^"

await page.goto(url)
await page.locator("#username").fill("")
await page.locator("#password").fill("")

### **Alerts Handling (Dialogs) in Playwright**

1. How do you handle JavaScript alerts, confirms, and prompts in Playwright?
2. What is `page.on('dialog')` and how do you use it?
3. How do you test alert confirmation logic in Playwright??

Handling alerts :

if(alertName==='confirm'){
    //alert===confirm
    //confirm===confirm
    type.dismiss()
}else{
    type.accept()
}
    })

**Sample Code:**

page.on('dialog', async dialog => {
  console.log(dialog.message());
  expect(dialog.message()).toBe("I am a JS Confirm")
  await dialog.accept();  // or dialog.dismiss();
});

###**Frames and iFrames in Playwright**

1. How do you interact with elements inside an iframe?
2. What is the difference between `page.frame()` and `frameLocator()`?

page.frame() --> Selects a frame by name, URL, or index
framelocator()--> directly locatesand autowaits for elements inside the frame

3. How do you handle nested iframes?
**Sample Code:**

const frame1 = page.frame({ name: 'frameName' });
await frame?.click('text=Submit'); // ?.Optional chaining operator

Or with `frameLocator`:

await page.frameLocator('#frameId').locator('text=Submit').click();

###Playwright Assertions


1. What are assertions in Playwright?

2. What are some commonly used Playwright assertions methods?

3. How does Playwright handle auto-waiting in assertions?

4. What is the difference between toHaveText() and toContainText() when applied to multiple elements?

5. How do you assert numerical values with Playwright?

6. How do you assert on soft expectations in Playwright?

7. What is the timeout for assertions, and how can you customize it?

await expect(page.locator("#status")).toHaveText("Success",{timeout:3000})
