📝 Keep your physical notebook and pen handy to sketch out ideas!


Notes:

page fixture:

const browser = chromium.launch() --> Connect btowser engine
const context = browser.newContext() --> Window launched
const page = context.newPage() --> a tab is loaded in that particular Window

In playwright API testing happens by directly hitting your CDP network tabs :

request fixture :

const apiContext = request.newContext() // "request" is an API client similar to that of a browser
const response = apiContext.post()

APIRequestContext--> Interface provided by Playwright to make your API calls.
