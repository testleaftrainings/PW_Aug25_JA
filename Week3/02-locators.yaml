Interview Questions Locators:
--------------------------

1. Can CSS move from child to parent like XPath?

No.



2. Whatâ€™s the difference between page.locator() and page.$()?

page.locator() â†’ Returns a Locator object, supports auto-waiting, retries, multiple interactions.

page.$() â†’ Returns a single ElementHandle, no retries, less recommended.

Example:

await page.locator('#login').click();   // recommended
const btn = await page.$('#login');     // ElementHandle
await btn.click();                      // manual wait needed

3. Difference between page.locator() and page.getBy*() locators?

page.locator() â†’ Uses CSS/XPath selectors. Example: page.locator("#username").

page.getBy*() â†’ Uses semantic locators (role, text, label, placeholder, testId). Example: page.getByPlaceholder("Email").
ðŸ‘‰ Recommended: getBy*() because itâ€™s more readable and stable.

4. Difference between locator.click() and page.click()?

locator.click() â†’ Works on a Locator object, supports auto-waiting and retries.

page.click() â†’ Direct action, needs selector every time, less flexible.
ðŸ‘‰ Recommended: locator.click() for reliability.

 5. How does Playwright handle auto-waiting for locators?

Playwright automatically waits for elements to be:

Attached to the DOM

Visible

Enabled
ðŸ‘‰ So no need for sleep() or manual waits.

 6. Difference between first(), last(), and nth() in locators?

locator.first() â†’ Selects the first element.

locator.last() â†’ Selects the last element.

locator.nth(i) â†’ Selects element at index i (0-based).



When you have multiple matching elements, you get error as "STRICT MODE VIOLATION".
